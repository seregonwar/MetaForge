# MetaForge Design Philosophy

MetaForge was created with the following principles in mind:

---

## 1. Low-Level Control
MetaForge provides fine-grained control over memory and system resources, empowering developers to write efficient and optimized code.

---

## 2. Interoperability
Seamless integration with Python, C, and C++ allows developers to combine the strengths of multiple languages.

---

## 3. Simplicity and Readability
While offering low-level features, MetaForge maintains a syntax that prioritizes clarity and simplicity.

---

## 4. Extensibility
MetaForge is designed to grow, with future support for web platforms and additional languages.

---

## 5. Security
Built-in cryptographic primitives ensure secure data handling and enable easy implementation of encryption and hashing.

**MetaForge: A language crafted for developers, by developers.**
